            <p> Howdy, my name is Juliana Leano and I am a senior engineering computer science major at 
               Texas A&M University. I have always loved music, whether it be through dancing from ballet 
               to zumba, through playing an instrument, like the cello and piano, or going to concerts and 
               taking it all in. I have also always been fascinated with video games, both how they work and 
               the creativity that goes into bringing them to life. 
            </p>
               
            <p> Along with playing instruments, I was in several different orchestras, ranging from beginner 
               to professional enough to compete with other students. Playing in an orchestra is almost a completely
               different endeavour to playing alone. It requires not only knowing, and in some cases memorizing, your
               part of the piece, it also demands intense concentration, the ability to communicate clearly and quickly
               with the other players around you, the ability to follow the conductor or the first chair even if they 
               change something the day of the performance, and the skill to know how and where you fit in with the rest 
               of the orchestra.

               Of the past projects I have completed, one that gave me some trouble but also ended up being a very interesting project to 
               work on was a Seam Carving program. The process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving">Seam Carving</a> is a program
               that is able to find the most important, or parts most people would care about the most, parts of an image and allow for someone
               to rescale their image with minimal warping. It does this by finding some seams, or paths of pixels that are deemed unimportant and
               either removes or adds to them depending on how the user wants to resize the image. This allows for images to be resized with different
               ratios from the original image and minimizes how distorted they get. While difficult in the beginning, starting to understand the process
               and how to code it out greatly helped me learn how to think about and process much larger coding assignments than I was used to.
            </p>
            <p>
               For a project I would like to complete in the future, I am very interested in making a website of some sort that is able to hold and 
               organize large amounts of information for the sake of archival. Some of the features would be easy access, highly organized group of 
               information and the ability to sort that information in many different ways with different topics or connections. I would want both the 
               design and the code to be able to support and store several varying types of information and media, like podcasts and more audio based
               products, videos, images, tweets, blogs, and more. I would also want to implement a tagging system where different pieces of media can 
               be tagged for easy search as well as for the ability to include or exclude certain tags from search to help users find information 
               as specific as they want as easily as possible, especially if it exists scattered about the internet.

            <p> I currently do not have a singular interest for where I want to focus in computer science, however what I have seen
               from computer graphics and game design appeals to me. I am still learning about the field of computing, and the main 
               interest I do have is I would love to work in something that challenges me not only intellectually but also creatively.

            <p>In the past, I have volunteered at food pantries as well as 
               <a href="https://catholiccharities.org/our-services/promoting-independence-for-seniors-veterans-others/senior-services/mamie-george-community-center/">organizations</a> 
               that help people with daily supplies when they are in a situation where they can't afford them, 
               such as losing a job or a house. For example, after hurricane Harvey I helped pack and organize food, clothing, and 
               supplies for people that have lost their homes in the destruction. 
            </p>
            <p> I also volunteer at my local library back home and work with the children there. Libraries and maintaining them are very important to me as they are vital 
               for so many people as a source of  
               <a href ="http://publiclibrariesonline.org/2013/04/community-centered-23-reasons-why-your-library-is-the-most-important-place-in-town/">education, safety, and a place to work.</a>   
            </p>
            <p> In high school, when I had more time, I also helped build decks and stairs for free as a part of an organization called 
               <a href="https://faithinactionofbrazosport.org/">Faith in Action </a>for families that needed them and did not have the funds to pay for them. 
               I would love to work on a <a href="https://www.habitat.org/emea">Habitat for Humanity</a> house in the future but haven't been able to join one yet due to time. </p>
